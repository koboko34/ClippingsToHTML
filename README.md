# ClippingsToHTML

This project was created to easily create Anki cards from Amazon Kindle clippings using Yomichan.

The program takes clippings from an Amazon Kindle in a txt format and convert them into a neatly
formatted HTML file. The text can then easily be parsed using browser extensions such as Yomichan.
